            <p>Ellie is the second protaganist of the first game and the main lead of the second game. She tries her best to survive the apocalypse alongside Joel and her other campanions.</p></div>

            <img src="./images/joel.jpeg">
            <p>Joel is the main protaganist of the first game and takes up the resoponsibility of getting Ellie to the other side of zombie-stricken USA. After losing his daughter at the start of the outbreak, he becomes hardened by his circumstances but Ellie comes along and replaces the hole that his daughter left.</p></div>

            <img src="./images/dina.jpeg">
            <p>While this may be a controversial opinion, I think Dina is a very cool character and brings out the best in Ellie. She is very carefree and joyous and always looks for the best, in people and situations.</p></div>
            <div class="cards">
            <img src="./images/tommy.jpeg">
            <p>Tommy is Joel's older brother and appears in both the games. I think he is very much like Ellie and they both think violence is th answer to everything, as that is what they know best. He seeks revenge for the same reasons as Ellie does and so, they both relate in that way.</p></div>
