        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Melted butter</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Prepare an 8×8-inch baking tray by buttering it and lining it with parchment paper. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the melted butter, oil, both of the sugars, eggs, and vanilla. Using an electric hand mixer, beat this mixture for 5 minutes on high speed until it becomes very thick. (You can do this by hand, but you’ll need some elbow grease.)</li>
            <li>Over the same bowl, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet until it is JUST combined. You don’t want to overmix! Then, fold in half of the chocolate chunks.</li>
            <LI>our the batter into your prepared pan, smooth the top, and generously top with the remaining chocolate chunks.</LI>
            <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the center of the brownies no longer jiggles and is just set to touch. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
